# Insert regular expressions (regex's), one-per-line.
# These will be used to parse an irc bot's packlist for packs.

\[HorribleSubs\] Anime.*\[720p\]

# The regular expression above looks for a file with the name like:
# [HorribleSubs] Anime<anything here>[720p]
# notice the . in a regular expression means 'match any character'
# The * means 'match the previous character between 0 and infinity times'
# So .* matches any character any number of times.
# Brackets have a special meaning in a regex
# So if you want to search for a string containing a bracket
# you must 'escape' the bracket by putting a single \ in front of it
# Use the above template for dowloading a series of episodes.
