# irc

Lightweight irc client for xdcc (and maybe more!)

## Quick-start up for auto-updating

- Get command line git.

- In terminal change to desired download directory.

- Run these commands:

```bash
git init .
git remote add origin https://github.com/tystokes/irc.git
git pull origin master
```

- Now edit your main.py removing the commented git auto-update block.

- Edit the main to your liking.

- Your code should now auto update with every run of main.py.
